        <h2>Active Balance Board</h2>
         <p>Balance boards, such as wobble boards or tilt boards, are becoming more popular for those working to improve their balance; currently older adults, 
           those recovering from injuries, and athletes seem to be the primary users. These simple balance boards work by creating an unstable surface that the
           user has to balance on, and the difficulty of the task depends on the 'stiffness' of the board. When considering a person's ability to balance, there 
           are two primary variables: muscular stiffness (i.e. strength) and time-delay (i.e. response time). If we create a mathematical model of the coupled system
           involving a person and a balance board, it becomes clear that there are two variables that could be manipulated by a balance board in order to explore the 
           entire balance space: stiffness of the board and time-delay of the response. 
        </p>
        <p>For my Master's project, I created an active balance board that was able to be manipulated both in the stiffness, or strenght of the response, and the
          time-delay domain. The frame was manufactured from 80-20 and the platform was made of a 2' x 2' wooden sheet. The actuating element was pneumatic; we 
          utilized air cylinders on either side of the board to provide a spring-like response to the user. There was a linear potentiometer in-line with the 
          cylinders so that we knew the position of the board at all times. We used a National Instruments cRIO as the hardware interface, with LabView running
          the controller software.

        <h2>Disease Spread</h2>
        <p>As COVID-19 became a headline in the news in the United States, and after seeing a few data visualizations 
          capturing the spread of the disease, I thought it would be interesting to do a simple model showing how disease 
          spreads, and how various factors could change the dynamics. I started by creating a model with 100 particles, 
          where initially one particle was infected. I gave each particle an initial velocity, both in the x and y direction, 
          and made a rule saying if an uninfected particle came within a specific distance to an infected particle, 
          it would also become infected. A person is only contagious for a specified amount of time, so I set a defined 
          length of time when the particle would be able to spread the disease, and after that point, the particle was 
          marked as 'recovered', so it could not transmit or receive the disease.
        </p>
        <p><u>Moderately infectious, all particles moving, 1 initial carrier
          </u></p>

        <br>
        <p><u>Less infectious, all particles moving, 5 initial carriers
          </u></p>
        <p>An interesting thing to consider is how infectious the disease is. If the infectious radius is decreased, we see
          a clear change in the dynamics of the disease spread.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p><u>More infectious, all particles moving, 1 initial carrier
          </u></p>
        <p>Conversely, if the disease is even more infectious, with a larger infectious radius in the model, the number of
          infected cases rises quickly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="/../images/d=10, all moving, 1 int inf.png" alt="d=5,0-stat,1-int" width="500" height="150">

        <br>
        <p><u>Moderately infectious, 50% of particles moving, 1 initial carrier
          </u></p>
        <p>To represent preventative measures being put in place, such as stay-at-home orders, we can let some particles
          remain stationary instead of moving around as in the initial simulations. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>This successfully demonstrates the concept of "Flatten the Curve". We see that the infected curve is spread
        out over time, and it never gets to the number of cases at a given time that we saw in previous simulations.</p>
